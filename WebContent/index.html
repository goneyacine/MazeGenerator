<h2> About the algorithms i used to make this website </h2>
<h3>First : <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm">recursive division algorithm</a></h3>

<h4>Mazes can be created with recursive division, an algorithm which works as follows:
 Begin with the maze's space with no walls. Call this a chamber. Divide the chamber with a randomly positioned wall
  (or multiple walls) where each wall contains a randomly positioned passage opening within it. 
  Then recursively repeat the process on the subchambers until all chambers are minimum sized. 
  This method results in mazes with long straight walls crossing their space,
 making it easier to see which areas to avoid.
Recursive Maze generation
For example, in a rectangular maze, build at random points two walls that are perpendicular to each other.
 These two walls divide the large chamber into four smaller chambers separated by four walls. 
 Choose three of the four walls at random, and open a one cell-wide hole at a random point in each of the three.
  Continue in this manner recursively, until every chamber has a width of one cell in either of the two directions.</h4>

<h3>Second :<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* pathfinding(search) algorithm</a></h3>
<h4>A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, 
which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality,
 and optimal efficiency.[1] One major practical drawback is its space complexity,
  as it stores all generated nodes in memory. Thus, in practical travel-routing systems,
   it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance,
   [2] as well as memory-bounded approaches; however, 
  A* is still the best solution in many cases.[3]
Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael of Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International)
 first published the algorithm in 1968.[4] It can be seen as an extension of Edsger Dijkstra's 1959 algorithm.
  A* achieves better performance by using heuristics to guide its search.</h4>
